## Project Objective

[1]. Develop a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to accurately assess the quality of red and white wines based on various chemical properties and attributes

[2]. Evaluate and compare the performance of different machine learning algorithms to determine the most effective approach for wine quality prediction providing insight for potential industry application 

[3]. Develop an API to consume the model
[4]. Package the model for CI/CD

## Business Objectives

[1]. *Enhanced Product Quality*: Accurate wine quality prediction will lead to improved quality and consistency, enhancing the winery's reputation and customer satisfaction 
[2]. *Cost Optimization*: Optimal resources allocation and reduced wastage through predictive modelling will result in a cost savings of wineries, improving overall operational efficiency
[3]. *Market Competitiveness*: Consistent production of high-quality wines will give wineries a competitive advantage, allowing them to stand out in the market and attract more customers.
[4]. *Better Customer Experience*
[5]. *Improved Revenue*
