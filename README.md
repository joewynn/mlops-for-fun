# Wine Classifier App

Starting, the Goal is very simple. Implement a machine learning classifier API for wine source dataset.

Tasks: 

- Develop a wine classification model. In this case we created a `Decision Tree Classifier` on Wine data set the comes with `scikit-learn`. 

- Serialize the model for portability. 

- Build a classifier App using `Docker`. 

- Serve the classifier from an API.
