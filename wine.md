# Wine Classification Problem

Wine is the fermented juice of grapes. 

Wine can be classified in a variety of ways including color, residual sugar content, carbon dioxide content, alcohol content or graph variety. Generally there are five basic characteristics of wine
- Sweetness - that is the level of residual sugar left in the wine after its creation
- Acidity - it gives it sharpness - high acidity wine are often tart and zesty. A well-balanced wine is so called as it has acidity, sweetness and tnnin in perfect harmony
- Tannin - tannin is the presence of phenolic compounds that add bitterness to a wine, and also adds balance ans structure, and helps wine last longer
- Alcohol: wine alcohol percentage level have the biggest impact on a wine's character, body and classification. 
- Body - it can help to think of a wine's body like milk, with skimmed milk representing a light wine, and cream representing a full-bodied wine. it is said if a wine's taste linges in your mouth for more than 30 seconds, it's almost certainly a full-bodied wine

As can be seen, these characteristics are very subjective to human nature, and the outcome may differe from one individual to another. Machine learning provides an impartial way to predict the quality of the wine. 

We'll work with three types of datasets to solve three different problems

## The Dataset

### Wine Type Dataset

### Wine Quality Dataset
The [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/static/public/186/wine+quality.zip) we use is from [UCI Machine Learning Wine Quality Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality) which are the result of a physicochemical analysis of wines grown in Portugal related to red and white variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. 

The physicochemical analysis determines is conducted and wine expert determine the quality of the wine. 

The attributes from the physicochemical analysis tests : 

the attributes in the data are: 
1) Fixed Acidity
2) Volatile Acidity
3) Citric Acid
4) Residual Sugar  
5) Chlorides
6) Free Sulfur Dioxide
7) Total Sulfur Dioxide
8) Density
9) pH
10) Sulphates
11) Alcohol

The expert valued sensory data score
12) Quality Score (between 0 and 10)


The Machine Learning Objective of the problem is  to create a prediction model that will utilize data gathered from the results of a chemical analysis of wines grown in the Nothern Part of Portugal and predict the quality class of the wine.

### Project Objective
- develop a predictive model using maching learning algorithms accurately assess the quality of red and white wines based on various chemical properties and atributes
- evaluate and compre the performanace of differnt machile nearing algorithmes to detmrin th emost effective approach for wine quality predcition providing insith tfor potential industry application 
- develop an api to consume the model
- package the model for 

### Business Objectives

1 *Enhanced Product Quality*; Acurate wine quality prediction will lead to improved quality and consistency, enhancing the winery reputatoin and customer satisfacton 
2. cost optimization : optimal reousec allocation and reduced wastage through predictive modeling will result in cost saving of wineris, improving overall opreational efficiency
3. Market competitivenes: Cosnistent production of high-quality wines will give wineries competitive advantage, allowing them to stand out int he market and attract more customers.
